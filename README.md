# :hotel: Hestia web3 application

### - Description

### Hestia meaning hospitality and home was created from the imminent need for proper hospitality and gunuine living conditions.

## :grimacing: The Problem
### The real estate sector in Africa has been ultimately centralized. Central agents in-between online housing deals inflate price, compromising the seemless transaction utility that should be experienced by users. 

## :mechanical_arm: The Solution (HESTIA)
### Harnessing the power of POLYGON, Hestia removes the need for central agencies making the transaction process between the buyer and seller as fast, seemless and decentralized as possible. Using a mint function each house listed for sale automatically mints a NFT for that property which provides proof of ownership onchain. Once a buyer successfully purchases or rents the property, the NFT is transferred to the wallet of the buyer. 

## :family_man_girl_boy: Community
### Holders of the NFTs gets automatic access to our community where we share resources, host AMAs, events and spread awareness on the need for better 'Life on land' and help build sustainable cities & communities.

## :rocket: Aim
### 40% of our total earnings will be donated to organizations and causes that supports two of the United Nations Sustainable Developement Goals 'Life On Land' and 'Sustainable Cities & Communities'. As a team we are passionate about humane living conditions and building the transition to a decentralized real estate sector in Africa! powered by a community dedicated to this cause.
